# New-World-Economy-Tracker

New World has a town-based economy, where each city generates tax revenue based on the number of players that use the services in town. The revenue can be seen in-game at the Governor's desk.

This program, given screenshots of the town's payroll page, populates a spreadsheet with the town's financial information. It utilizes Google's cloud-vision API to read the text on the images.

(I have since stopped playing the game so this is not being updated)
